# Usage

Just download the [zip file](github.com/abbanfahim/mdx-framework), and extract into your project.

> Note: I recommend storing the contents of your app uncustomised app first in a zip file, to reuse for later projects.

Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies, and `npm start` to view the site locally.
